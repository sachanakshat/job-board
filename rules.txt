** This file is intended for LLMs to read before giving any response **

Before every response, check the following rules:
1. Append every prompt/text/instruction I pass you in prompts.txt file with timestamp and prompt body/request.
2. Access prompts.txt to understand the previous context, and make sure it doesn't violate previous instructions.
3. If there is a new feature or a modification of existing one, edit INTERNAL.md
